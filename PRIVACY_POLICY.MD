# Privacy Policy for Feed The Dog

**Last updated:** February 14, 2025

Feed The Dog ("we," "our," or "the app") is a mobile and web application that helps you track your dog's feeding schedule and share care responsibilities with your household. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account Information

When you sign in with Google, we receive:

- **Email address** – from your Google account
- **Name** – your display name or full name from your Google profile
- **User ID** – a unique identifier assigned by our authentication provider

### 1.2 Data You Provide

- **Dog profiles** – name, breed, weight, age, and icon preferences for your dogs
- **Feeding schedules** – meal times, amounts (in grams), water preferences, and extra instructions
- **Feed logs** – when you fed your dog, amount given, and optional notes
- **Household information** – household name and member relationships (when you share care with others)

### 1.3 Device and Technical Data

- **Push notification tokens** – to send reminders and notifications to your device (iOS, Android, or web)
- **Notification preferences** – whether you want schedule reminders, "someone else fed" alerts, etc.

### 1.4 Activity Data

We store activity events (e.g., when a dog was added, when a schedule changed) to sync history across your devices and household members.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- **Provide the app** – store and sync your dogs, schedules, and feed logs across your devices
- **Enable household sharing** – let household members see shared dogs and feeding history
- **Send notifications** – remind you of feeding times and notify you when someone else logs a feeding
- **Display attribution** – show who performed each feeding in shared households (using display names)
- **Support account management** – allow you to sign in, sign out, and delete your account

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- Your data is stored on **Supabase** (a cloud database and authentication provider) in secure, encrypted databases.
- We use **Row Level Security (RLS)** so that you can only access your own data and data shared within your household.
- Authentication is handled via **Google OAuth** and **Supabase Auth**; we do not store your Google password.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We rely on the following third-party services:

| Service | Purpose | Privacy Policy |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Supabase** | Database, authentication, real-time sync | [supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy) |
| **Google** | Sign-in (OAuth) | [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| **Expo** | App framework, push notifications | [expo.dev/privacy](https://expo.dev/privacy) |

## 5. Data Sharing

- **Within your household** – Household members can see shared dogs, schedules, feed logs, and who performed each feeding. Display names (from your Google profile) are visible only to household members.
- **We do not sell your data** – We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.
- **Legal requirements** – We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and safety.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

- **Access and correction** – You can view and update your dog profiles, schedules, and notification preferences in the app.
- **Account deletion** – You can delete your account from the Account screen. This removes your account and personal data. Historical feed logs may be retained in anonymized form (e.g., "Deleted user") for household history.
- **Notification control** – You can disable notifications or specific notification types in the app settings.

## 7. Data Retention

- **Active accounts** – Your data is retained while your account is active.
- **Deleted accounts** – When you delete your account, we remove your profile, preferences, and push tokens. Some historical records (e.g., feed logs) may retain a "Deleted user" attribution for household history integrity.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Feed The Dog is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy on this page and update the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
